# Embed Content into a WebVI

# Embed a WebVI into Web Content
This example demonstrates embedding a Web VI built using LabVIEW NXG 2.0 Beta into an entirely different static Web page. WebVIs are composed of three basic parts: HTML5 Custom Elements which compose the view of the page, the WebVI block diagram (.via.txt) which provides the client side logic, and the JavaScript and CSS files that make the Web application run. Because these are the same basic building blocks (san via.txt) of all other Web pages you can pull the Web VI apart and embed it with any Web content.

# Multiple Top-Level VIs

This example demonstrates usage of multiple Top-Level VIs in a NXG Component. Each Top-Level VI is built into a separate HTML file and using the hyperlink control one can create links pointing between different Top-Level VIs. The example uses the Component name and the VI name to create relative urls that point between the corresponding built HTML pages.
