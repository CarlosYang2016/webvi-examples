- Please use all of the default namespaces and directory names when building the Web Application in each example
- Fork or branch this repo and work on a single example in a single branch at a time

# Embed a WebVI into Web Content
This example demonstrates embedding a Web VI built using LabVIEW NXG 2.0 Beta into an entirely different static Web page. WebVIs are composed of three basic parts: HTML5 Custom Elements which compose the view of the page, the WebVI block diagram (.via.txt) which provides the client side logic, and the JavaScript and CSS files that make the Web application run. Because these are the same basic building blocks (san via.txt) of all other Web pages you can pull the Web VI apart and embed it with any Web content.
